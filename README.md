# js-two-way-binding

A simple two way binding implementation with plain javascript. All credit goes to the original implementor. This fork is an attempt to understand, document the code, and make it usable in development and to avoid use of frameworks.

Original implementation was generalised for use with few minor tweaks.
- property types handled expanded
- "use strict" enabled for JS code with var declaration
- property change functions generalised
- some comments added in code
